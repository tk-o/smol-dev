1. **HTML Elements IDs**: These are unique identifiers for HTML elements that are used in CSS for styling and in JavaScript for manipulating the DOM. Shared IDs might include "header", "footer", "main-content", "subscription-form", etc.

2. **CSS Classes**: These are identifiers used in CSS to apply styles to HTML elements. Since we're using Tailwind CSS, we'll have classes like "container", "text-center", "bg-white", etc.

3. **Tailwind CSS**: This is a utility-first CSS framework that we're using for styling. It will be used across all HTML files.

4. **JavaScript Functions**: These are blocks of code designed to perform a particular task. A function is executed when something invokes it. Shared functions might include "validateEmail()" for the subscription form, "submitForm()" etc.

5. **Data Schemas**: These define the structure of the data. In this case, we might have a simple schema for the subscription form, including fields like "email".

6. **Exported Variables**: These are variables that are made available to other files. In this case, we might have variables like "subscriptionFormData" in main.js that are used in subscription_form.html.

7. **Message Names**: These are identifiers for messages that are sent between different parts of the application. For example, we might have a "formSubmitted" message that is sent when the subscription form is submitted.

8. **Dependencies**: These are libraries or frameworks that our code relies on. In this case, our main dependencies are Advanced HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS.
